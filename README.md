# Gumi-Gota-Engine
This project is COMPLETELY made for fun purposes.

I am trying to create a game engine that would allow me to create simple multiplayer FPS game. I am only following online tutorials to see how much one can learn without paying anything.

The engine at its final state is supposed to be able to render 2D scenes, 3D scenes, have simple physics system, and support multiplayer connections.
