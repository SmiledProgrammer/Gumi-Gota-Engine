# Gumi-Gota-Engine
This project is COMPLETELY made for fun purposes.

I am trying to create a game engine that would allow me to create simple multiplayer FPS game. I am only following online tutorials to see how much one can learn without paying anything.

The engine at its final state is supposed to be able to render 2D scenes, 3D scenes (with lights, shadows, realistic water, reflections, etc.), have simple physics system, and support multiplayer connections.


The project was started at the end of March 2018. The expected finish time (when engine will have all the things listed above) is September 2018.
